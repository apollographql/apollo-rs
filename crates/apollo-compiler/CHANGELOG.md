## Features
- **add parser recursion limit API - [SimonSapin], [pull/353], [issue/296]**

  Calling `ApolloCompiler::with_recursion_limit` instead of `ApolloCompiler::new`
  makes the compiler configure [the corresponding parser limit][with].
  This limit protects against stack overflow and is enabled either way.
  Configuring it may be useful for example if youâ€™re also configuring the stack size.

- **expose the repeatable attribute on `DirectiveDefinition` - [allancalix], [pull/367]**

  There was previously no way to access the `repeatable` field on the `DirectiveDefinition` type.
  This field is required for validation rules.

  [pull/367]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/367

- **add type extensions - [SimonSapin], [pull/369]**

  apollo-compiler now partially supports GraphQL `extend` types. The `is_subtype` query takes
  extensions into account.

  Some other parts of the compiler, like validation, do not yet support extensions.

  [pull/369]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/369

## Fixes
- **fix `@include` allowed directive locations - [allancalix], [pull/366]**

  The locations for the `@include` directive wrongly specified `FragmentDefinition` instead of `FragmentSpread`.
  It now matches the spec.

  [pull/366]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/366

## Maintenance
- **avoid double lookup in `SchemaDefinition::{query,mutation,subscription}` - [SimonSapin], [pull/364]**

# [0.3.0](https://crates.io/crates/apollo-compiler/0.3.0) - 2022-11-02
## Breaking
- **compiler.parse is renamed to compiler.ast - [lrlna], [pull/290]**

  `compiler.ast()` returns the `SyntaxTree` produced by the parser and is much
  clearer method than `compiler.parse()`.

  [lrlna]: https://github.com/lrlna
  [pull/290]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/290

- **selection.ty(db) now expects a `db` parameter - [lrlna], [pull/290]**

  As byproduct of separating compiler's query_groups into individual components.
  Selection's type can now be accessed like so:

    ```rust
    let ctx = ApolloCompiler::new(input);
    let top_product_fields: Vec<String> = top_products
      .iter()
      .filter_map(|field| Some(field.ty(&ctx.db)?.name()))
      .collect();
    ```

  [lrlna]: https://github.com/lrlna
  [pull/290]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/290

- **removes db.definitions() API - [lrlna], [pull/295]**

  `db.definitions()` returned a `!Send` value that is no longer possible with
  the `ParallelDatabase` implementation.

  To access HIR definitions, use `db.db_definitions()` and `db.type_system_definitions`.

  [lrlna]: https://github.com/lrlna
  [pull/295]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/295

## Features
- **add subtype_map and is_subtype queries - [lrlna]/[SimonSapin], [pull/333]**

  This allows users to check whether a particular type is a subtype of another
  type. For example, in a UnionDefinition such as `union SearchResult = Photo |
  Person`, `Person` is a suptype of `SearchResult`. In an InterfaceDefinition such
  as `type Business implements NamedEntity & ValuedEntity { # fields }`,
  `Business` is a subtype of `NamedEntity`.

  [pull/333]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/333

- **pub compiler storage - allow database composition - [lrlna], [pull/328]**

  This allows for internal query_groups to be exported, and allows users to
  compose various databases from compiler's existing dbs and their queries.

  This is how you'd create a database with storage from apollo-compiler:
    ```rust
    use apollo_compiler::{database::{AstStorage, DocumentStorage}};

    #[salsa::database(AstStorage, DoumentStorage)]
    pub struct AnotherDatabase {
        pub storage: salsa::Storage<AnotherDatabase>,
    }
    ```

  You can also see a more detailed linting example in [examples] dir.

- **validate argument name uniqueness - [goto-bus-stop], [pull/317]**

  It's an error to declare or provide multiple arguments by the same name, eg:

    ```graphql
    type Query {
      things(offset: Int!, offset: Int!): [Thing]
      # ERR: duplicate argument definition: offset
    }
    ```

    ```graphql
    query GetThings {
      things(offset: 10, offset: 20) { id }
      # ERR: duplicate argument values: offset
    }
    ```

  This adds `UniqueArgument` diagnostics and checks for argument duplications in:
  field definitions, fields, directives, interfaces and directive definitions.

  [pull/317]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/317

- **getter for directives in HIR FragmentSpread - [allancalix], [pull/315]**

  Allow accessing directives in a given FragmentSpread node in a high-level
  intermediate representation of the compiler.

  [allancalix]: https://github.com/allancalix
  [pull/315]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/315

- **create validation database - [lrlna], [pull/303]**

  All validation now happens in its own database, which can be accessed with
  `ValidationDatabase` and `ValidationStorage`.

  [lrlna]: https://github.com/lrlna
  [pull/303]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/303

- **thread-safe compiler: introduce snapshots - [lrlna], [pull/295] + [pull/332]**

  Implements `ParallelDatabase` for `RootDatabase` of the compiler. This allows
  us to create snapshots that can allow users to query the database from
  multiple threads. For example:

    ```rust
    let input = r#"
    type Query {
      website: URL,
      amount: Int
    }

    scalar URL @specifiedBy(url: "https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986")
    "#;

    let ctx = ApolloCompiler::new(input);
    let diagnostics = ctx.validate();
    for diagnostic in &diagnostics {
        println!("{}", diagnostic);
    }

    assert!(diagnostics.is_empty());

    let snapshot = ctx.snapshot();
    let snapshot2 = ctx.snapshot();

    let thread1 = std::thread::spawn(move || snapshot.find_object_type_by_name("Query".into()));
    let thread2 = std::thread::spawn(move || snapshot2.scalars());

    thread1.join().expect("object_type_by_name panicked");
    thread2.join().expect("scalars failed");
    ```

  [pull/332]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/332

- **add description getters to compiler's HIR nodes - [aschaeffer], [pull/289]**

  Expose getters for descriptions that can be accessed for any definitions that
  support them. For example:
    ```rust
    let input = r#"
    "Books in a given libary"
    type Book {
      id: ID!
    }
    "#;

    let ctx = ApolloCompiler::new(input);

    let desc = ctx.db.find_object_type_by_name("Book".to_string()).unwrap().description();
    ```

## Fixes
- **update parser version - [goto-bus-stop], [pull/331]**

  [goto-bus-stop]: https://github.com/goto-bus-stop
  [pull/331]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/331

- **unused variables return an error diagnostic - [lrlna], [pull/314]**

  We were previously returning a warning for any unused variables, it is now
  reported as an error.

  [lrlna]: https://github.com/lrlna
  [pull/314]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/314
## Maintenance
- **split up db into several components - [lrlna], [pull/290]**

  We are splitting up the single `query_group` we had in our db into several
  `query_group`s that currently just build upon each other, and eventually could
  support more complex relationships between one another. The current structure:

  `Inputs` --> `DocumentParser` --> `Definitions` --> `Document`

  All of these `query_group`s make up the `RootDatabase`, i.e. `salsa::database`.

  This also allows external users to build out their own databases with
  compiler's query groups.

  [pull/290]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/290

- **support wasm compiler target - [allancalix], [pull/287], [issue/288]**

  `apollo-compiler` can now compile to a Wasm target with `cargo check --target wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

  [allancalix]: https://github.com/allancalix
  [pull/287]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/287

# [0.2.0](https://crates.io/crates/apollo-compiler/0.2.0) - 2022-08-16

## Breaking
- **inline_fragment().type_condition() returns Option<&str> - [lrlna], [pull/282]**

  Instead of returning `Option<&String>`, we now return `Option<&str>`

  [lrlna]: https://github.com/lrlna
  [pull/272]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/282

- **Value -> DefaultValue for default_value fields - [lrlna], [pull/276]**

  default_value getters in Input Value Definitions and Variable Definitions now
  return `DefaultValue` type. This is a type alias to Value, and makes it
  consistent with the GraphQL spec.

  [lrlna]: https://github.com/lrlna
  [pull/276]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/276

## Fixes
- **add type information to inline fragments  - [lrlna], [pull/282], [issue/280]**

  Inline fragments were missing type correct type information. We now search for
  applicable type's fields if a type condition exists, otherwise infer
  information from the current type in scope ([as per spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sel-GAFbfJABAB_F3kG ))
  .Inline fragments

  [issue/280]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/issues/280

- **fix cycle error in fragment spreads referencing fragments - [lrlna], [pull/283], [issue/281]**

  Because fragment definitions can have fragment spreads, we are running into a
  self-referential cycle when searching for a fragment definition to get its id.
  Instead, search for the fragment definition when getting a fragment in a
  fragment spread in the wrapper API.

  [pull/268]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/268

- **default_value getter in input_value_definition - [lrlna], [pull/273]**

  A getter for default values in input value definitions.

  [pull/273]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/273

- **feat(compiler): add db.find_union_by_name() - [lrlna], [pull/272]**

  Allows to query unions in the database.

  [lrlna]: https://github.com/lrlna
  [pull/272]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/272

- **adds inline_fragments getter to SelectionSet - [lrlna], [pull/282]**

  Convenience method to get all inline fragments in the current selection set.
