## Breaking
- **inline_fragment().type_condition() returns Option<&str> - [lrlna], [pull/282]**

  Instead of returning `Option<&String>`, we now return `Option<&str>`

  [pull/272]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/pull/282

- **Value -> DefaultValue for default_value fields - [lrlna], [pull/276]**

  default_value getters in Input Value Definitions and Variable Definitions now
  return `DefaultValue` type. This is a type alias to Value, and makes it
  consistent with the GraphQL spec.

## Fixes
- **add type information to inline fragments  - [lrlna], [pull/282], [issue/280]**

  Inline fragments were missing type correct type information. We now search for
  applicable type's fields if a type condition exists, otherwise infer
  information from the current type in scope ([as per spec](https://spec.graphql.org/October2021/#sel-GAFbfJABAB_F3kG ))

  [issue/280]: https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-rs/issues/280

- **fix cycle error in fragment spreads referencing fragments - [lrlna], [pull/283], [issue/281]**

  Because fragment definitions can have fragment spreads, we are running into a
  self-referential cycle when searching for a fragment definition to get its id.
  Instead, search for the fragment definition when getting a fragment in a
  fragment spread in the wrapper API.
